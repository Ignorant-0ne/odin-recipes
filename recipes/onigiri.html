        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup water</li>
            <li>2/3 short-grain rice, rinsed</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>3 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1 inch strips</li>
            <li>seasoned sesame seeds to taste</li>
            <li>shiso with hijiki (dried seaweed flakes) to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine rice and water in a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes. Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Once water is boiling, reduce heat to low and cook until water is completely absorbed, 12 to 13 minutes. Remove from the heat; keep covered and steam for another 10 minutes. Remove lid and cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands and form small amounts of rice into triangle shapes if possible, or round balls. Wrap each onigiri with a strip of nori. Season with salt and garnish with sesame seeds and seaweed flakes.</li>
        </ol>
