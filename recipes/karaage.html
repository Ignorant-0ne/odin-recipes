        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>schen1</em> says that this karaage recipe is very easy to make and guests always enjoy eating it. It can be served as an appetizer or as a quick weekday dinner over a bed of rice.</p>
        <p>Marinating the chicken pieces the night before gives the karaage more flavour. But even if prepared as a last-minute meal, the dipping sauce shall alleviate all worries. Serve it hot with shredded lettuce and a lemon wedge.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Chicken:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 Â½ tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sauce:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup Japanese mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 table spoon low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon honey, garlic, and ginger together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Beat egg in a bowl until smooth. Add panko bread crumbs to a shallow bowl. Dip chicken into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into panko until completely coated. Place the breaded chicken, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lower chicken carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
            <li>Whisk Japanese mayonnaise, mirin, 2 tablespoons honey, Dijon mustard, and 1 tablespoon soy sauce together in a bowl; pour sauce over chicken.</li>
        </ol>
