Build a basic recipe website

By completing this project I will have demonstrated my ability to follow instructions and produce a satisfactory result. 

And also, that I can use basic commands for linux, git and html to operate the command line for the creation and manipulation of directories, files and websites.

I can also navigate my way through github, albeit just barely.
